After creating a Dockerfile, which is a text document that contains *commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image*, we ran `docker build` command, this one uses the Dockerfile to build a new container image. As we noticed the Docker downloaded a lot of *layers*. This is because we instructed the builder that we want to start from the `node:18-alpine` image. But since we did not have that on our machine, Docker needed to download the image.
