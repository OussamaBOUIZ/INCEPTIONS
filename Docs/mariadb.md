# What is A RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ?
RDBMS is a system that manages relational databases. It provides an organized and structured approach to store, manage and retrieve data using a tabular format based on rows of columns.

1. Relational Model: This represents data as tables (referred to as relations). Each table consists of rows *records* and columns *attributes*. The relationships between tbles are established through keys and foreign key constraints.
2. Query Language: RDBMS provides a standardized language called **Structured Query Language** for managing the DBs. It comes with powerful capabilities, including *joins*, *aggregations*, *sorting* and *filtering*.
3. Data Relationships: RDMS allows the definition and enforcement of relationships between tables through *primary and foreign key associations*. This allows efficient data retrieval through *joins*, which help representing complex relationships between entities.
