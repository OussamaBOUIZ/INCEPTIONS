# What is the problem that docker solves ?
When proceeding for the deployment of applications, there are many bumps on the way, caused by distinctions between operating systems.

Docker deals with this problem through packaging programs along with all their dependencies into lightweight, isolated containers that we can think of briefly as a small virtual machine containing only the sufficing tools to run a specific software.
You could say that virtualization already fixes this issue, but
